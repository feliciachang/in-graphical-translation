    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      My design professor, Pamela Hovland once described type as a container.
      What information can typography hold besides content?
    </p>
    <p>
      How can we derive a more direct relationship between type and the space in
      which it sits? Can they speak the same visual language, share the same
      formal qualities?
    </p>
    <p>
      These questions culminated in two image-making tools that seek to
      translate between the two elements we use most in design: type and image.

        <h2>Image as Type</h2>
        <p>
          Type as Image is a tool that extracts shapes, particularly rectangles
          and circles from images to create endlessly generative letterforms

        <h2>Type as Image</h2>
        <p>
          Image as Type is a typographic projection tool. 2D images are
          converted to 3D models. Text can then be projected onto a sequence of
          images.

        <h3>The Making of Nature</h3>
        <p>
          The Making of Nature is a chapbook that combines my collection of leaf
          images with Joyce Carol Oates' "Against Nature." During the semester,
          I collected leaves on my walks to Covid-19 tests twice a week.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the midst of this act of nature appreciation, I read "Against
          Nature" which portrays nature in its cruel, honest form. I wanted to
          subvert my own work by "glitching" in the same way Joyce Carol Oates
          removes us from our conventional understanding of nature.

        <h3>Cacophany</h3>
        <p>
          Cacophany is a short film that explores a narrative told by sentence
          pairs, sound and image. Daily domestic life is juxtaposed with a
          variety of bird calls, collected from the National Park Service
          database.
        </p>
        <p>
          This juxtaposition is meant to demonstrate how society removes us from
          nature, and thus the death that arises from climate change.

    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>
      I would like to thank my advisors, Professor Holly Rushmeier and Professor
      Julian Bittiner for their support, advice and guidance â€“ all of which were
      very much needed for the fruition of my thesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to also thank professors, Pamela Hovland, Verlyn Klinkenborg,
      Alexander Valentine, and Chris Pullman for stretching my design and
      artistic practice in ways I would not have imagined.
